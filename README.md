## 📊 Methodology

This analysis follows a structured approach:

### 1. Web Scraping

- Scrape iPhone product listings from **Flipkart**.
- Extract relevant details such as:
  - Product Name
  - Price
  - Storage Variants
  - Ratings
  - Number of Reviews
- Use **Beautiful Soup** to develop a scraping script.
- Store extracted data in a CSV file while ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Load the CSV file into a **pandas DataFrame**.
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and clean text formats.
- Standardize numerical formats (e.g., currency, numeric values).
- Convert categorical features where necessary.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights such as:
  - Distribution of prices
  - Customer rating trends
  - Correlations between price, ratings, and reviews

### 3. Data Storage

- Store the cleaned dataset in a **relational database** (SQL-based) for structured access.
- Use **SQLAlchemy** for database integration.
- Enable efficient querying for future analysis.

### 4. Unsupervised Learning

- Apply clustering techniques to group similar iPhone models.
- Select relevant features such as storage size, price, and rating.
- Implement **K-means clustering** to identify market segments.
- Optimize the number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Add a new column to indicate cluster membership for each product.

### 5. Supervised Learning

- Train classification models to predict price categories and customer preferences.
- Implement:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score**.
- Analyze the impact of features such as storage size and ratings on price prediction.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Optimize model performance using **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.
- Document the best configuration that enhances model accuracy.
- Perform feature selection to improve prediction performance.
